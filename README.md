Easily configurable way to model non-linear systems. 
Number of nueral network layers can be expanded. 
Currently using a Leaky Rectified Exponential Linear unit to prevent dead spots in the Nueral net. Does not prevent update explosions of the node weights and bias. 

Outputs are a gif demonstrating the training of the model.
Training cost and Test accuracy plots

Future adaptations would be to adpat it for non-linear logistic regression analysis for classification objectives.
